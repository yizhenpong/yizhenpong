- 👋 Hi, I’m @yizhenpong
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, mathematics, puzzle solving, sudokus, and sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently seeking to pick up more data science skillsets, training my logical thinking and improving my coding techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that may involve handling business data, or even more niche areas - understanding the human condition, mystery games, sports. 
- 📫 Please reach out to me via yizhenpong at gmail dot com if you have any opportunities
